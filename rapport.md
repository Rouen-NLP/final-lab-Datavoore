# Tobacco trial classification report

##### Robin Niel

## 1) Problem description

### 1.1) Context

In the 60s, more and more studies were showing the negative effect of tobacco on the health of the people. In order to keep their profit going, tobacco companies decided to organize and create a national public relation campaign in order to counter the different proves of the danger of tobacco. A trial was intended by the U.S governement against those companies. During this trial, more than 14 millions documents has been collected and numerized. Those documents can be classified in 10 different classes. Our task in this practical work is to create a machine learning model able to classify those documents. 

### 1.2) The data 

For this practical work, we have at our disposal 3482 documents distributed over 10 different classes which are the following : 

* Advertisement 

* Email 

* Form 

* Letter 

* Memo 

* Opening News 

* Note 

* Report 

* Resume 

* Scientific 

We can plot a pie chart in order to see the distribution of the different classes in the data. Here is the pie chart :
